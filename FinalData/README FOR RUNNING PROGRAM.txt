To run the program you must run the server.py file and after the server is up and running type http://127.0.0.1:5000/ into the browser.

-If you encounter any image problems run the finalData.py to fix

- Also, the barcode images will be saved into the root file of FinalData when the programs runs if you wish to see it.

-Contact me at 6478094308 if problems persist.

-See video attached if have problems with running the program
